This project demonstrates concepts covering the creation and management of multithreaded programs and inter-process communication. The specific example in the program file uses concurrent threading in a banking context to showcase thread safety principles with tools such as mutex locks and thread ordering. Additionally, the IPC file showcases inter-process communication through the use of pipes.

Steps for building and running the program:
1. Download both the IPC.cs and Program.cs files
2. Build both files
3. Ensure startup object set to either IPC.cs or Program.cs
4. Run the program
Files run on .NET Framwork. There are no specific dependencies.
